    "Measures of central tendency are statistical tools used to summarize a set of data by identifying a central or \"typical\" value. The three main measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode. Each has unique characteristics and is best suited to certain types of data and distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean (Average) The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the total number of values. It’s a useful measure for continuous data and provides an overall average.\n",
    "Formula: Mean = ∑ values number of values Mean= number of values ∑values​\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: In a dataset of test scores [ 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 110 ] [70,80,90,100,110], the mean would be:\n",

    "Mean = 70 + 80 + 90 + 100 + 110 5 = 90 Mean= 5 70+80+90+100+110​=90 When to Use: The mean is best used for data that is symmetrically distributed without outliers. For example, it’s ideal for calculating the average income of employees if salaries are relatively similar, or for determining the average temperature over a week if temperatures do not vary significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Not to Use: The mean can be misleading when data has extreme outliers (e.g., income data where a few individuals have very high incomes), as the outliers can skew the mean.\n",

    "Median The median is the middle value of an ordered dataset. If there’s an odd number of values, the median is the middle one; if there’s an even number, it’s the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "Example: In the test scores dataset [ 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 110 ] [70,80,90,100,110], the median is 90 (the middle value).\n",
    "\n",
    "For [ 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 ] [70,80,90,100], the median would be 80 + 90 2 = 85 2 80+90​=85. When to Use: The median is useful for skewed data or when there are outliers. For example, when analyzing household incomes, where a few high earners can skew the mean, the median provides a better \"typical\" income for the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Not to Use: The median may not be as informative when data is symmetrical and without significant outliers, as it doesn’t account for all values in the dataset, potentially missing subtle trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), more than one mode (bimodal, multimodal), or no mode at all.\n",
    "Example: In the dataset [ 5 , 8 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 12 ] [5,8,8,9,10,10,10,12], the mode is 10, as it appears most often.\n",
    "\n",
    "When to Use: The mode is useful for categorical data or for identifying the most common value in a dataset. It’s especially relevant in qualitative data (e.g., the most common color chosen by survey respondents) or in skewed distributions where the most frequent value is of interest.\n",

    "Dispersion refers to the extent to which data values in a dataset vary or spread out from the center. Understanding dispersion is essential because it provides insight into the variability within the data and helps us understand how consistent or scattered the data points are around a central tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "1)Variance Variance quantifies the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It essentially measures how much the values in a dataset differ from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance = ∑ ( 𝑥 𝑖 − mean ) 2 𝑛 (for a population) Variance= n ∑(x i​−mean) 2\n",

    "\n",
    "​(for a sample) where 𝑥 𝑖 x i​represents each data point, and 𝑛 n is the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: A higher variance indicates that data points are more spread out from the mean, showing greater variability. A lower variance suggests that data points are closer to the mean, showing more consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have the test scores for two classes, a class with high variance will have scores spread widely across a range, while a class with low variance will have scores clustered around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitation: Variance is expressed in squared units, which may not be intuitive in practical terms. For instance, if the data represents the height in centimeters, the variance will be in square centimeters, which may be harder to interpret.\n",
    "\n",
    "2)Standard Deviation Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It’s a more interpretable measure of dispersion because it’s in the same unit as the original data, making it easier to understand the typical distance of data points from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation = Variance Standard Deviation= Variance​\n",
    "\n",
    "Interpretation: Standard deviation provides a measure of how much the data typically deviates from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in a dataset of daily temperatures with a standard deviation of 2°C, most days’ temperatures are within 2°C above or below the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates greater spread, while a lower standard deviation suggests that data points are closer to the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages: Standard deviation is easier to interpret than variance because it matches the unit of the data. It’s commonly used in statistical applications to gauge consistency or volatility in data."

    "3)Range and Outliers:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The whiskers give a quick idea of the overall range of the data. Outliers are marked outside the whiskers, helping to identify any extreme values that deviate significantly from the rest of the dataset.\r\n",

    "4)Ability to Estimate Population Variability:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Random samples allow for measuring population variability (e.g., through standard deviation or variance), offering insights into the spread and dispersion of characteristics within the population. By estimating variability, researchers can assess the reliability of sample-based estimates and better understand the diversity within the population.\r\n",

    "\r\n",
    "3)No Skewness (Symmetrical):\r\n",

    "In a symmetrical distribution, there is no skew, and the data is evenly distributed around the center. Here, the mean, median, and mode are typically equal.\r\n",

    "Effects of Skewness on Data Interpretation\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1)Mean and Median Discrepancy:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In a skewed distribution, the mean is pulled in the direction of the skew due to extreme values, while the median is more resistant to such outliers. For positively skewed data, the mean is greater than the median, and for negatively skewed data, the mean is less than the median. This discrepancy can misrepresent the “typical” value of the data if only the mean is considered.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2)Choice of Measures of Central Tendency:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "In skewed data, the median is often a better measure of central tendency than the mean, as it is less affected by extreme values. For example, in income data with positive skew, the median income better represents the \"typical\" income since a few high earners inflate the mean.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3)Impact on Statistical Analysis:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Many statistical methods assume normal (symmetrical) distributions. When data is highly skewed, these methods may produce inaccurate or biased results. Skewed data may require transformations (such as logarithmic transformations) to make it more symmetrical before applying parametric tests or regression analysis."
